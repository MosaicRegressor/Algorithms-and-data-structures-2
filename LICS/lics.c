/*
we are using dynamic programming.

rules to compute the len of the lics up to a certain point:
1. it must be a subsequence
2. it must be common between X and Y
3. it must be increasing
4. it must be the longest

remember: we are computing the lics UP TO A CERTAIN CHARACTER(we keep reusing this info, this alternate problem is what makes caching possible)

we got two strings, X and Y.
we align them with a matrix.
We start iterating through the strings step by step(the rule #1 is satisfied).
We compare the two characters.
If we got two different characters, we are breaking the rule #2, so the len of the lics up to that point is 0.
If we got two characters that are equal rule #1 is satisfied, therefore we look at the previously computed results: between them we find the
lengths of licses that end with a compatible character(to safisfy rule #3), and we pick the max between them(to satisfy rule #4)   

due to dynamic programming, the execution time goes from 2^n to n^4, so cool!! :))
